## Tasks

# Current
x highlight selected area of venn diagram 
  - NOTE: only consider simplest case: 2 or more circles intersect, click on intersect area. For future, consider case when a different, 'clicked' circle overlaps intersection area.

  x get all intersection points of 'clicked' circles with each other
  x start from midpoint in group of intersections
  x going clockwise, find common parentCircle in each pair of points.
  x generate arcs with p1, p2, and parentCircle's radius.
  x draw path with arcs data.

- Refactor spaghetti code
- Migrate away from using d3
- keep selected area highlighted when moving circles around
- unselect area when clicking the section again
- have multiple selected sections

# Future

x upload a file, show a circle representing the file
x drag file to browser window, display droplayer overlay on svg
