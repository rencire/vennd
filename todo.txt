## Tasks

# Current
- highlight selected area of venn diagram 
  - NOTE: only consider simplest case: 2 or more circles intersect, click on intersect area. For future, consider case when a different, 'clicked' circle overlaps intersection area.

  x get all intersection points of 'clicked' circles with each other
  - start from midpoint in group of intersections
  - going clockwise, find common parentCircle in each pair of points.
  - generate arcs with p1, p2, and parentCircle's radius.
  - draw path with arcs data.

# Future 
- make droplayer prettier


# Past
x Make circles clickable and draggable
x Allow user to remove circle.
x upload a file, show a circle representing the file
x drag file to browser window, display droplayer overlay on svg
x select a circle, display corresponding file contents
x click intersection of two circles, display results 
x drag n drop text file to Board to create circle
