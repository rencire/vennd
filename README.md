#Vennd

This a personal side project for learning the basics of manipulating shapes with D3 and javascript, along with exploring the HTML File api.

##Features
- Drag and drop multiples files to play around with the venn diagram shapes.  By selecting an interseciton, we can see the common lines in each file

##TODO
- UI
  - Show overlap region more clearly.
  - Consider removing the 'Drop here to visualize'. Need some way to 'lead the user' to drop files.

- Alg
  - Improve matching algorithm (right now simply checks to see if lines between text files are same)

- Testing
  - More Tests
